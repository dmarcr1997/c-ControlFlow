# c-ControlFlow

###Write a program that calculates the sum of a collection of positive integers that
are entered by the user from the keyboard. Your program should prompt the user
to enter each integer followed by the return key, and to enter “−1” at the end
of the list of integers to be added. Note that there is no need to store the list of
integers: you can keep track of the sum as the user is entering the values.
2. Modify your code so that the code terminates if the sum of integers entered up to
that point exceeds 100.
3. Modify your code so that, if the user has entered an incorrect integer, they may
enter “−2” to reset the sum to zero and begin entering integers again.###


# c-vect

efine vectors x, y, and z, and matrices C and D, such that
x = u − v,
y = Au,
z = Au − v,
C = 4A − 3B,
D = AB.
